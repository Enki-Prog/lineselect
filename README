lineselect
----------

This is a silly little hack that reads a set of lines from stdin, lets
you choose one, and prints it back out on stdout.  I got the idea from
Thomas Badie in this thread:

  http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/202535

You can optionally specify a regex argument.  If you do, only lines
that match the regex are eligible for selection, and only the first
group of the match is printed to stdout.

Used with clever bash key bindings to quickly insert something from
a long list of choices.

Example with git:

  insert () {
      READLINE_LINE="${READLINE_LINE:0:$READLINE_POINT}$1${READLINE_LINE:$READLINE_POINT}"
      READLINE_POINT=$(($READLINE_POINT + ${#1}))
  }
  
  insert_sha1_from_log () {
      str=$(git log --oneline --decorate --graph --date-order | ../lineselect '[|* ]* ([0-9a-f]+)')
      if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  	insert "$str"
      fi
  }
  
  bind -x '"\C-x^": insert_sha1_from_log'

Now you can hit C-x ^ to quickly choose and insert a SHA1 from the
git log of the current repository.
